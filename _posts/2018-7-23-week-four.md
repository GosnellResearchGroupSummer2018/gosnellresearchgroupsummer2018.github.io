This past week felt like the last big push that we had to make before starting the real science. Marta finished adding WCS information to all of the RGBHÎ± data we have from the DIAFI instrument at the University of Texas, one of the crucial early steps in this project. Rory and Thom have also moved on from aperture photometry and are now using DOLPHOT, a PSF photometry program by Andrew Dolphin that should give us more accurate measures of flux. We should have DOLPHOT up and running by the end of this week. Marta is also working on reducing DIAFI data this week, and we will likely begin photometric analysis starting next week. This is a very exciting time for the project because, while the progress we've made can be described in only a few sentences as above, it feels tangible because we are now biting into the real data and can see that we'll be able to start making real conclusions soon.
